	Just open the directory of the problem that you want to run,
	Modify "input.txt" as your wish, and
	Then open the directory in the terminal and copy and paste the following command.

Problem1:
	javac Problem1.java
	java Problem1

Probem2:
	javac Problem2.java
	java Problem2
	
Sir, you can also the run "25.sh" to do all the above for you by following instructions.
Before running it just run: 
	chmod +x 25.sh
in the terminal.
